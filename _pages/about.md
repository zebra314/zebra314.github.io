## About

<div id="en" style="display:none;">
  Born in 2003 from Chiayi, I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering at NCTU. Got hooked on photography and coding during my college days, and that’s how this website came to life.
  <br><br>
  Always wandering between numbers and symbols, with a head full of chaotic thoughts. Loves fried rice from stir-fry shops, dreams of living by the sea, owning a cat, and sleeping in forever.

<div id="zh-TW" style="display:none;">
  2003年生，嘉義人，在交通大學唸機械。大學時迷上攝影與寫程式，這個網站因此而生。時常迷惘在數字、符號間，腦子裡總塞滿著混亂思緒。喜歡熱炒店的炒飯，以後想住海邊、養隻貓咪，還有睡飽。
